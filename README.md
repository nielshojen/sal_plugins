# Sal Plugins
This repository collects the plugins for the Sal management tool that I have
borrowed, stolen or written. Some of them are made by others but modified for my use.

## Installation

Clone or copy this project into your Sal plugin directory. The folder must be
named `nielshojen`, so if git cloning, do `git clone
https://github.com/nielshojen/sal_plugins nielshojen`.  The
advantage of cloning the repo is that you can easily "upgrade" by doing a `git
pull`. If you are concerned about managing those changes, please feel free to
fork the repo.
